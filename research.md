    Economic growth is often a disruptive social process - so how has the Chinese state been able to maintain compliance from its people while at the same time pushing ahead an exceptionally rapid social and economic transformation? This book explores the question via detailed analysis of the trajectories, policy rationale, and effects of China’s pension reforms, demonstrating how statecraft shapes the ways that citizens ascribe credit and responsibility for pensions protection across themselves, the state and other actors. The book shows that China’s governmentality for manufacturing compliance is hybrid, organic, and dynamic. The targeted allocation of benefits, policy experimentation, propaganda and knowledge construction, and many other approaches are used to shape public expectations and to justify state rule. An original contribution to the study of legitimation in modern states, the analysis particularly highlights that when active counter-conduct (such as resistance) is confined, individuals may choose cognitive rebellion and falsify their public compliance.

    How do modern states legitimise and frame their redistributive social policies in communicating with society to promote policy changes? What kind of ‘structures of incentives’ are being promoted in their narratives? This article takes the pension reform in China in the 1990s and the 2000s as an example, using text data on corresponding official propaganda to investigate the Chinese state’s ideological repertories in framing and crafting the social legitimacy of its then-new pension designs. The results from Quantitative Text Analysis of official discourse demonstrate that the rationale for reconstructing public expectations of the redistribution of pension benefits and the allocation of welfare responsibility between the government and individuals mainly focuses on the reiteration of the principles of: ‘contribution and rewards’ and ‘rights and obligations.’ The state also built images of deserving and undeserving social groups by reconstructing the notion of fairness, blurring the distinction between merit and equity, and ultimately reshaping individual subjectivity as a self-regulated and self-motivated ‘socialised self’.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Traditional wisdom on policy experimentation has mainly focused on central-local relations. However, scholars have paid little attention to the interaction between policy experimentation and the public. We argue that policy experimentation can be adopted by decision makers as a communication instrument with the public, facilitating the building of a social consensus regarding controversial policies. We evaluate the effects of the Chinese government’s efforts in promoting shared responsibility between the state and the individuals for the urban pension system with policy experimentation on public’s regime support. Evidence from two rounds of a nationwide survey conducted before and after the policy experiment indicates that the implementation of policy experiment has significantly contributed to citizens’ acceptance of individual welfare responsibility. Moreover, the image building of governmental responsibility via official news with varied intensity across local regions immediately consolidates the political trust of residents while posing threats to government credibility in the long run.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Chinese idol fans have been identified among the main forces in cyber nationalist activisms in recent years, acting as the nationalist fans protecting the state as an idol in response to external political shocks. Their skills in acknowledging, involving, and even reinventing the image of the state and national pride in cyber nationalist activisms do not emerge in a vacuum. This article examines how idol fans involve and reinvent the nationalist discourse in their everyday fan activities – idol promotion. We focus on the pandemic in 2020 as it provides a specific social and political context that allows us to understand better the interaction between idol fans and the state in their mundane fan activities. We construct our analysis under the computational grounded theory framework with over 6 million fan posts collected from Weibo and 11 in-depth interviews with active idol fans. Our findings show that when engaging in pandemicrelated discussion, idol fans actively borrowed official discourse on nationalism and strategically responded to key political and social events in their idol promotion activities. The idol images they built are not only positive but also nationalist. Therefore, they play not only the commercial logic commonly seen in the Japanese and Korean Kpop/idol culture but also the political logic propagated by the state in China.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Political leaders in China regularly launch anti-corruption campaigns to win public support. But how are anti-corruption signals perceived? We use event study to examine the case of Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign – an unprecedented effort in China to fight corruption. Contrary to expectations, we find that for the firms with connected officials later investigated, the initial anti-corruption signals – speeches from the top leadership and earlier crackdowns on other senior officials – did not decrease their stock prices. We argue that the perceived high costs of following through and repeated campaigns in the past paradoxically nurtured cynicism. We exploit the case of Zhou Yongkang and Ling Jihua – the two officials who were alleged to be involved in the power struggle and whose downfall had circulated widely since 2012. We find that when the targets of earlier crackdowns were connected to Zhou or Ling, the stock prices of the firms went down only if their connected and later investigated officials were in the same faction; the stock prices of the other firms, however, went up. We interpret the results as investors’ misperceptions of the campaign in the beginning. Our findings suggest that even real efforts in campaign-style enforcement can be dismissed.

- **Yan WANG**. Pragmatism or politicism: Local officials’ decision making in policy experimentation. 2022. *SSRN* <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4222285">Available here</a>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    It has been widely recognized that local bureaucrats are crucial actors in policy process. In policy experimentation—a popular policy instrument in social welfare areas—which heavily relies on negotiation and interaction between different sectors, local bureaucrats are the main actors that initiate the experiment plan, propose policy innovation, and implement the pilot schemes. Then what do they value when deciding on local social policies, and why would they prefer some policy-experiment schemes over others? In this research, we use two unique studies with survey experiments on municipal- and county-level government officials in China and investigate their rationale and attention allocation on social policy preferences, as well as their decision making on policy experiments. Our results show that although the instruction and support from the upper-level governments are as vital as the local initiatives, local officials are more practical than political in many scenarios of local social policy making, where under similar conditions they react more strongly to societal demands. This pragmatism is especially true in deciding the preferred pilot scheme—they place more value on financial support, local conditions, and risk environment, while the political load of the pilot schemes have relatively less leverage in changing their preference. More importantly, such a pattern is consistent across different administrative types and regional subgroups of local officials.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    COVID-19 has shifted how citizens interact profoundly. Private life is frequently dis- played in the public space and individuals are held to account should their exercise of liberty enlarges COVID-19 transmission risks. We are interested in the evolving dynam- ics among fellow citizens, especially when and how individuals react to others’ COVID-19 related actions and behavior. An extensive data set of Sina Weibo posts consisting of more than four million COVID-19 related posts provides us with a lens to answer the questions. By estimating the general sentiment of Weibo posts from January to Decem- ber 2020, as well as two in-depth case studies, we capture the information flows and discussion volumes in the public space. Combining the machine learning approach with discourse analysis, we find that the psycho-social cycle model identified in past public health emergencies and other societies during the COVID-19 pandemic also occurred in China, although demonstrating unique timing and sequence characteristics that are linked to China’s epidemic situation and policies. The all-society solidarity built at the begin- ning of 2020 was later challenged, and potentially eroded by the process of moralizing fellow citizens’ COVID-related behavior via blaming, discriminating, and scapegoating. As society lives under the pandemic for longer, fellow citizens have become more aware of problems associated with unbounded public scrutiny of private life. Such awareness and reflection, herein, encourages discussion and consensus building efforts.

- Ting LUO, **Yan WANG**. The art of storytelling: Pro-regime narratives on Chinese social media and the official opinion leaders. Under Review. 
    <details>
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The Chinese government under Xi Jinping has taken an active role in shaping and leading online discussions in cyberspace in order to occupy the battlefield of online public opinion. While much is known about the strategies and tactics used by various online actors to promote pro-regime messages, we know little about how narratives are constructed in these messages. In this paper, we propose the theoretical framework of event-based narratives and the detailed storytelling in the pro-regime messages promoted by key opinion leaders on Chinese social media platform. We drew a random sample of all Weibo verified users and collected all posts posed by them between January and May 2022, yielding a total of over three million posts by government accounts, organizations, enterprises, media, and celebrities. With linguistic algorithm that captures the action, the agent performing that action, and the patient being acted upon, we unravel the storytelling and meaning construction of subject-object-action network of four trending topics related to four key social-economic events at the time — the Beijing Winter Olympics, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Shanghai Lockdown, and the chained mother likely to be a victim of human trafficking found in Jiangsu Province. In each of these events the state plays varied roles of either initiative or responsive, and the tactics the state involve influencing the public opinion are distinctive. The elements, strategies, and beliefs including focusing on the rational data and positive energy in Shanghai Lockdown, wind down the public discussions and focus on the local problems in the Fengxian Events. There are also highlights of national pride and an entertaining glory in Winter Olympics, and redirect the discussions to the evil US, and rationales for Russia’s move in Russia-Ukraine war. We also present the different narratives across government, media, and celebrities’ accounts, as well as the diffusion pattern of some key narratives. Our work shed new light on how online opinion leaders construct the narratives and stories in various scenarios, as well as the relationship between the state, platforms, and the public in discipling public opinion and constructing pro-regime mainstream consensus in authoritarian regimes.

- Pol Rovira-Wilde, **Yan WANG**. Towards a Natural Language Processing Pipeline for Measuring Types of Issue-specific Polarisation using UK Party Manifestos. Working paper.
    <details>
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This paper presents an NLP pipeline that measures both types of issue-specific polarisation (ideological and salience) between political parties using manifestos. Whilst current NLP methods either conflate or only measure one type of issue-specific polarisation, this study's pipeline measures both types independently, allowing one to explore the potential relationship between different types of polarisation. Furthermore, the pipeline addresses other limitations with current methods such as confounding by lexical overlap and concealing variation in polarisation across issues. To provide a framework for analysing the pipeline, its outputs are used to identify which issues are proprietal, conflictual or consensual. Using the UK Labour and Conservative parties' General Election manifestos from 2001-2024, the pipeline segments manifestos into sentence-level semantic units and then applies BERTopic so that each sentence is labelled with distinct issue topics. Issue-salience polarisation is measured by comparing normalised topic frequency, whilst ideological polarisation is measured using ManifestoBERTa embeddings and cosine dissimilarity. Results show that issues like Healthcare were consensual as they exhibited low ideological polarisation, in contrast to conflictual issues like Immigration. Additionally, the EU was especially polarised in salience during the 2010's, making it a proprietal issue despite ideological polarisation. Future enhancements could include integrating NLP tools into the pipeline that allow for a qualitative analysis of polarised issues to supplement its existing quantitative analysis.

- Cleavage map and the focal issues: the attitudinal divisions in cyberspace on re-distributive social welfare. Working paper.
    <details>
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Disagreement among the population regarding redistributive issues is highly visible in cyberspace, where people debate the necessity, legitimacy, and feasibility of social security, tax cuts, strikes, and other related topics. This study examines debates on public forums, combining state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to investigate the presentation and variation of online attitudinal divisions related to redistributive social issues such as council tax, universal income, and minimum wage. We collected analytical data from Reddit, focusing on debates within the UKPolitics subreddit after 2020. Fine-tuned BERTopic models were applied for topic discovery; sentiment analysis was conducted using BERT trained on the GOEMOTIONS dataset; and narrative structure analysis was carried out using the RELATIO package to extract key narratives from the conversations. This initial analysis revealed key thematic patterns and variations in public attitudes toward the selected redistributional issues. Sentiment trends also responded swiftly to major social and political events at the time, such as the mini-budget, increases in council tax, changes to the minimum wage, and national insurance policies. These discussions further revealed distinct framing dimensions commonly found in social policy literature—namely, self-interest, fairness, deservingness, and the role of government. Our work also highlights the conversational structure of online debates, showing how stances shift and what rationales individuals rely on in forming their arguments. This project offers an initial exploration of how attitudinal social cleavages manifest in cyberspace in response to redistributional issues with distinct characteristics and political agendas.
